# Thesis Data Analysis

## Description
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for the statistical analysis of various hypotheses in my thesis, focusing on the impact of emotional intelligence on M&A outcomes. The notebooks are organized based on the specific hypotheses they address: Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 2, and Hypothesis 4.

## Contents
- `Hypothesis 1.ipynb`: This notebook includes the analysis for Hypothesis 1, covering data loading, preprocessing, statistical testing (such as T-tests), and generating visualizations like box plots.
- `Hypothesis 2.ipynb`: Similar to the first, this notebook is dedicated to the analysis for Hypothesis 2, encompassing data manipulation, statistical calculations, and graphical representation of the results.
- `Hypothesis 4.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on Hypothesis 4, providing steps for data handling, statistical analysis, and visualization of the findings.

## How to Use
To use these notebooks, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy) installed in your environment. The notebooks can be run in environments like Jupyter or Google Colab to perform the analysis for each hypothesis.

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine or open it in Google Colab.
2. The required data files are not included in this repository due to reasons of confidentiality. To replicate the analyses, you should use similarly structured data.
3. Execute the cells in each notebook to observe the analysis process and results.

## Data
The data used in these analyses are a part of my thesis research and are not publicly available in this repository due to confidentiality reasons. The notebooks are structured to work with data formatted in a specific way, aligning with the analyses demonstrated.
